Got no time on my hands
But my friend likes to call me every day
And I think of the past
And I dream of better days

When the sun used to hit my face
When the sun used to hit my face
Yeah I dream of better days
Yeah I dream of better days

And it's not like I want to hurt you
And it's not like I want to see you cry

But I've made mistakes
Let me tell you that I'm sorry
But I've gone the wrong way
Let me tell you I'm on the right track

I'm sorry I never text you back
I'm sorry I left such a mess
I'm sorry I never text you back
I'm sorry I left such a mess

And it's not like I want to hurt you
And it's not like I want to see you cry

And it's not like I like to do these things on purpose
And it's not like I love saying goodbye
