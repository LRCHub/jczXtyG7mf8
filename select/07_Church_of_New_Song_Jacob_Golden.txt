I can feel the earth move when I say her name
I keep jumping off of a bullet train

I wasn't trying to pick a fight but i deserved to
Get my ass kicked that night
Shadow boxing
My way out of an army of doubt

When the church of new song came and my headphones
Lifted me up again buzzing on the the radiation
Of my secret radio station

I woke up this morning and it hurt so bad

I just wanted to burn everything i had
I was leaving on a black horse
It was a switchblade
Fight between marriage and divorce
Shadow boxing
My way out of an army of doubt

When the church of new song came and my headphones
Lifted me up again buzzing on the the radiation
Of my secret radio station
